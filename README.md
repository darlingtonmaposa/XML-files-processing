# XML-files-processing

In an industry-type ETL process, it is prevalent to **apply further transformations** on data extracted into a **tabular format**. It is also very likely that we will have to **join this data** with other **data sources** as well. Therefore dealing with data in its raw format is a valuable skill for a data engineer.

This project uses a **sample XML file** that needs to be transformed into a **tabular format** and extracted into a CSV file. From here further ETL processes are easier to implement.
